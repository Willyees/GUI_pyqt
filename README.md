Honours project - Napier University - 2018/2019

## Aim
The project is focused in applying different machine learning techniques to the problem of network intrusion detection. Amongst the available appoaches, anomaly detection is used to find deviations from normal network traffic, discovering possible attacks.

A desktop application has been created that let the user import datasets to be analyzed. Different types of algorithms can be applied, letting the user compare their results, understading which performs better and what might be the shortcomings.


## Overview
The application has preloaded two datasets that can be used to view its capabilities quickly, without the need to create and import any dataset.

The first is "KDD99", a dateset used in Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competitionthe, available at [http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html). The competition was aimed to build network intrusion detectors.

It is a very large csv file, loaded directly from the sklearn module, so it must be installed in order to load the dataset.

The second is a very small dataset "TEST" mostly used for debugging purposes because it can load very quickly.
